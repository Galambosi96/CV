  <p>I broke my wrist on 30th January 2022, 3 months ago from the time of writing,
    having a hard working job, I started becoming quite worried thinking that I
    would probably not be able to do it anymore, and then, long story short,
    after a long conversation with my cousin, who works in this field already,
    I got the idea of starting to learn and become a web developer, in order to
    change my current occupation, having a less strenous job, but at the same
    time, doing something that I would enjoy, and that would give me satisfaction.
    In the meanwhile, I started loving the idea of coding. This is my first
    project.</p>
